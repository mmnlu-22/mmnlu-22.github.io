A Workshop Colocated with EMNLP 2022 in Abu Dhabi and Online
Dec 7, 2022

*Let’s scale natural language understanding technology to every language on Earth!*

By 2023 there will be over 8 billion virtual assistants worldwide, the majority of which will be on smartphones. Additionally, over 100 million smart speakers have been sold, most of which exclusively use a voice interface and require Natural Language Understanding (NLU) during every user interaction in order to function. However, even as we approach the point in which there will be more virtual assistants than people in the world, major virtual assistants still only support a small fraction of the world’s languages. This limitation is driven by the lack of labeled data, the expense associated with human-based quality assurance, model maintenance and update costs, and more. Innovation is how we will jump these hurdles. The vision of this workshop is to help propel natural language understanding technology into the 50-language, 100-language, and even the 1,000-language regime, both for production systems and for research endeavors.
