## Topics

We seek papers on the following topics:
* Work related to the shared tasks and our new dataset, including both modeling and linguistic analysis,
* Work related to other multilingual datasets and benchmarks in the NLU field, whether public or proprietary, including tasks beyond intent classification and slot filling,
* Exploration and visualization of multilingual representations,
* Data reduction and augmentation techniques to improve privacy and data efficiency in multilingual NLU systems,
* Analysis of tokenization methods, shared vocabulary strategies, and other orthographic and script-focused considerations,
* NLU work focused on low-resourced languages,
* Distillation, quantization, and compression of multilingual models, as well as other efforts related to production multilingual systems, and
* Editorials and opinion pieces related to multilinguality in NLU.

In general, any work related to the advancement of multilingual NLU models and systems will be considered. Negative results are also valuable and welcome.

Submissions need **not** be related to the shared task and competition.
