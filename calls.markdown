Our first call for papers has not yet been released, but we plan to welcome long and short papers on the following topics:
* Work related to the shared tasks and our new dataset, including both modeling and linguistic analysis,
* Work related to other multilingual datasets and benchmarks in the NLU field, whether public or proprietary, including tasks beyond intent classification and slot filling,
* Exploration and visualization of multilingual representations,
* Data reduction and augmentation techniques to improve privacy and data efficiency in multilingual NLU systems,
* Analysis of tokenization methods, shared vocabulary strategies, and other orthographic and script-focused considerations,
* NLU work focused on low-resourced languages,
* Distillation, quantization, and compression of multilingual models, as well as other efforts related to production multilingual systems, and
* Editorials and opinion pieces related to multilinguality in NLU.
In general, any work related to the advancement of multilingual NLU models and systems will be considered.
